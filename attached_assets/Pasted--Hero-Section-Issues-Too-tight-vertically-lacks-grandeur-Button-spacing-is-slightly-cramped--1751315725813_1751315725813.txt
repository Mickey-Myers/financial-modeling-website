🟦 Hero Section
Issues:

Too tight vertically; lacks grandeur.

Button spacing is slightly cramped.

"Our Approach" secondary button feels unimportant.

Fixes:

Add mt-16 mb-24 for breathing room.

Enlarge hero font (text-5xl lg:text-6xl) and increase line-height.

Button stack: widen spacing between the two and align vertically on mobile.

Consider adding a soft background pattern or subtle moving gradient for depth.

🟫 Services / “Our Approach”
Issues:

Icon styling is inconsistent (size, visual weight).

Grid feels cramped on desktop and over-stacked on mobile.

Fixes:

Standardize icons: use minimalist outline-style SVGs with equal width/height (e.g. w-8 h-8 text-gold)

Add consistent padding in all cards (p-6 lg:p-8) and gap-10 between columns.

Use lg:grid-cols-3 md:grid-cols-2 grid-cols-1 for responsiveness.

Add hover effect: very subtle upward lift with hover:translate-y-[-2px] and a faint shadow.

📊 Track Record ("Our Record")
Issues:

Typography doesn’t match headline scale.

Feels like a block of stats vs a designed section.

Fixes:

Add vertical dividers between each stat (use border-l border-gold/20 with px-8 spacing).

Convert all numbers to display serif (Playfair Display) and increase to text-5xl lg:text-6xl.

Add a supporting one-liner under each number in muted gold or slate text.

👥 Testimonials / “Client Perspectives”
Issues:

Quotes look like generic cards — needs prestige treatment.

Name/title hierarchy too flat.

Fixes:

Use quotation mark SVG at top left of each card.

Italicize quote content, reduce line length (max-w xl).

Title (CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER) should be text-sm uppercase tracking-wide, with firm name in text-xs text-slate-400.

🧑‍💼 Leadership Section
Issues:

Layout feels very “template grid” — lacks bio personality.

No photos or identifiers breaks trust.

Fixes:

Replace "MP" with initials in gold inside a round background circle (or just remove).

Add grayscale portrait images with rounded-full or rounded-xl.

Separate name from title with spacing and color (e.g. name white, role in slate).

🧭 Engagement Process
Issues:

The section is elegant but too rigidly centered.

Icon steps (I, II, III) don’t visually anchor.

Fixes:

Use a vertical line with nodes or number badges that animate slightly on scroll (animate-fadeIn).

Align text left with staggered layout (e.g., step I left, step II right, step III center).

Use text-gold/80 for duration labels like “30 MINUTES” / “5-7 DAYS”

🧩 Client Ecosystem
Issues:

The 4-column grid feels visually flat and unordered.

The font weights and color usage is too even — lacks hierarchy.

Fixes:

Make headers (PORTFOLIO COMPANIES, etc.) small caps (uppercase text-xs tracking-wider text-gold)

Use bullets or left-aligned line separators (border-l) to visually group entries

Introduce more spacing between column groups

📬 Contact Form
Issues:

Input boxes are dark-on-dark and look dull.

Button lacks contrast and is too compressed.

Fixes:

Add white borders (border-white/20) and more input padding (py-3 px-4)

Use focus:outline-gold to accent active fields

“BEGIN CONVERSATION” button should match hero CTA button and feel clickable (hover effect, larger font)

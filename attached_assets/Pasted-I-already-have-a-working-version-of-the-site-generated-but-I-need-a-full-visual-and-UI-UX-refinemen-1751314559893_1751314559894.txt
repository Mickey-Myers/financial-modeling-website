I already have a working version of the site generated, but I need a full visual and UI/UX refinement pass. The goal is to make this site look and feel like a prestigious institutional financial advisory firm ‚Äî think Moelis, Allen & Co., or Centerview Partners, not a startup.

The layout can remain largely the same, but design quality, spacing, typography, colors, and tone all need to be elevated.

üß± Design & Branding Direction:
‚úÖ What to Improve
Typography

Replace all fonts with:

Headlines: Playfair Display (or similar refined serif)

Body Text: Inter, IBM Plex Sans, or Source Serif Pro

Increase spacing between sections and use larger type sizes (especially in hero and service sections)

Color Scheme (Replace current blue/black theme)

Background: #FAFAF7 (soft ivory) OR #1A1A1A (for dark theme)

Primary Accent: #0B1F35 (deep oxford blue)

Secondary Accent: #A38658 (bronze) or #C1B398 (champagne)

Text: Almost-black or off-white depending on background

Buttons

Use full-width or capitalized text buttons with slimmer padding

Remove large border-radius (make squared or slightly rounded)

Keep hover effects subtle and elegant

Hero Section

Make headline larger and more elegant (centered or left-aligned with proper spacing)

Replace chart screenshot with a cleaner visual (e.g. blurred Excel model, branded graphic, or muted animated GIF if possible)

Use an editorial-style tagline below header (e.g. "Built by bankers. Trusted by funds.")

Services Section

Keep the 3-column layout but:

Use refined icons (minimalist, thin-line, matching the tone)

Unify card heights with equal spacing

Slight hover lift or shadow (subtle)

Track Record Section

Use serif numerals (visually elegant)

Left-align or center with balanced grid

Add optional muted gridlines for structure

Testimonials Section

Replace dark carousel with static quote blocks or a wall of testimonials

Italicize quotes and use spacing to elevate

Attribution in small caps or muted type (firm names optional)

Remove carousel dots and pause controls for cleaner UX

Team Section

Include space for black-and-white portraits or initials

Use stacked layout for bios with a 1-line summary for each

Consider using expand-on-click bio reveal for optional polish

Contact CTA

Use elevated language and layout:

‚ÄúLet‚Äôs Build Something Institutional.‚Äù

Slim horizontal form or scroll-triggered modal

‚úÖ Deliverables
Updated code with full design improvements above

Live preview link on Replit

Fonts hosted and loaded properly (Google Fonts is fine)

Optional: dark/light mode toggle if quick to implement

üí¨ Tone, Brand, and Target
Firm name: Financial Modeling Partners

Target client: Institutional ‚Äî PE/VC-backed companies, real estate developers, family offices

Design tone: Sophisticated, minimalist, editorial, credible

No cheesy icons, stock images, or overly ‚Äútechy‚Äù elements
